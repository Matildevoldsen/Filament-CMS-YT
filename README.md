Filament is a simple CMS for Laravel. It's designed to be a fast, simple, and you can learn how to build it through my 
YouTube series [Building a CMS with Filament and Laravel 10](youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjCZ5YN4HlacfJ_CR-CkwVBKWGC-z5_T-&si=R0C9-U4QqgqTj7lb).

```composer install```. Make sure you run ```npm install && npm run dev``` and to migrate your tables (``php artisan migrate``).

### Stability
